            <p>"Canada is having its worst fire season in modern history. The fires have burnt more than 20 million acres, casting hazardous smoke over parts of the U.S. and stretching Canadian firefighting resources thin." <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/11/1187105458/this-is-canadas-worst-fire-season-in-modern-history-but-its-not-new">[NPR]</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>Once a fire starts, it becomes extremely challenging to extinguish. The most efficient approach to minimizing losses is by preventing fires from occurring in the first place. Unfortunately, existing systems lack the capability to accurately predict fires. Moreover, traditional monitoring methods have limitations in terms of coverage range, cost, and maintenance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To address these challenges, this research proposes an innovative end-to-end forest fire risk assessment system that combines the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm, UAV imagery, and visualization techniques. This system effectively assesses the risk of forest fires and presents the information in a user-friendly manner for a wider audience.</p>
