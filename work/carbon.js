            <p>To accelerate the global trend of sustainability and enhance our understanding of forest carbon storage capabilities, this project aims to revolutionize the prediction of forest carbon using Google Earth Engine and machine learning methods. By harnessing the extensive geospatial data repository and processing capabilities of Google Earth Engine, combined with advanced machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to develop accurate and proactive forest carbon mapping models. These models will incorporate historical climate data, vegetation indices, and forest types to predict carbon storage globally.</p>
